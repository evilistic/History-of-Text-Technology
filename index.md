# A Harmony of Primeval Alphabets and Coding Languages

## Introduction
This website has been designed to present the culmination of my studies within the History of Text Technology class. Here I'll introduce imagery both historical and of my own adaptation. The goal is to analyse the significance of the of the original work, its audience, and how that might translate to audiences today. I mean to adapt this into the realm of coding languages in modern society.

## A Harmony of Primeval Alphabets
I found this text relatively recently while looking through old books at a swap shop. Having lived overseas in the military, I realized I had fondness for foreign languages, studying Japanese, French, Lingala, and minimally Czech. Because of that background, stumbling across a point of reference for various primeval alphabets was very exciting. While not entirely useful outside of archaeological or anthropoly circles, this work can service as the basis of reference in manners of presentation, rather than just content. With that in mind I wanted to adapt the methodology of presentation to coding languages. I had to make a leap here because generally coding languages are limited to the generalized structures of modern keyboards and their alphabets. Instead of an alphabetical reference, I thought it would be more appropriate to display examples of language syntax.

## A History of a Harmony
A Harmony of Primeval Alphabets includes 45 different alphabets, and was brought together by Reverend Charles Forster, published sometime between 1851 and 1871. A lithograph printed on linen. The purpose of the documentation was to serve as reference to those seeking insight into a language of study, or possibly to assist in identifying or deciphering newly uncovered artifacts or texts. It was also meant to serve as a historical record to document the alphabets of old. An attempt to consolidate the knowledge in the hopes that it wouldnt disappear entirely. While its important to preserve the alphabets of those of other cultures, an effort should be made to truthfully represent the cultures and their originality. The goal is not to appropriate, but to respectfully reflect and re-present.

## A History of Culture
The fact that the original work was published by a member of the clergy can provide insight into the cultural norm of the times. That members of the Church were often the most educated. Much like with that of Programming Languages today, the reference serves a small portion of the population who make time to study that specific field or time period. The documentation, accumulation, and dissemination of said references within those fields can have great impacts within the discourses and subcultures.
