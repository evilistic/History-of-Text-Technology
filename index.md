# A Harmony of Primeval Alphabets and Coding Languages

## Introduction
This website has been designed to present the culmination of my studies within the History of Text Technology class. Here I'll introduce imagery both historical and of my own adaptation. The goal is to analyse the significance of the of the original work, its audience, and how that might translate to audiences today. I mean to adapt this into the realm of coding languages in modern society.

## A Harmony of Primeval Alphabets
I found this text relatively recently while looking through old books at a swap shop. Having lived overseas in the military, I realized I had fondness for foreign languages, studying Japanese, French, Lingala, and minimally Czech. Because of that background, stumbling across a point of reference for various primeval alphabets was very exciting. While not entirely useful outside of archaeological or anthropoly circles, this work can service as the basis of reference in manners of presentation, rather than just content. With that in mind I wanted to adapt the methodology of presentation to coding languages. I had to make a leap here because generally coding languages are limited to the generalized structures of modern keyboards and their alphabets. Instead of an alphabetical reference, I thought it would be more appropriate to display examples of language syntax.

## A History of a Harmony
A Harmony of Primeval Alphabets includes 45 different alphabets, and was brought together by Reverend Charles Forster, published sometime between 1851 and 1871. A lithograph printed on linen. The purpose of the documentation was to serve as reference to those seeking insight into a language of study, or possibly to assist in identifying or deciphering newly uncovered artifacts or texts. It was also meant to serve as a historical record to document the alphabets of old. An attempt to consolidate the knowledge in the hopes that it wouldnt disappear entirely. While its important to preserve the alphabets of those of other cultures, an effort should be made to truthfully represent the cultures and their originality. The goal is not to appropriate, but to respectfully reflect and re-present.

## A History of Culture
The fact that the original work was published by a member of the clergy can provide insight into the cultural norm of the times. That members of the Church were often the most educated. Much like with that of Programming Languages today, the reference serves a small portion of the population who make time to study that specific field or time period. The documentation, accumulation, and dissemination of said references within those fields can have great impacts within the discourses and subcultures.

## Breaking down my Adaptation
In designing my adaptation, as mentioned abive, I chose to display syntax structures as they are the defining factors between languages using the same alphabets. I chose "Hello World" as my statement because it is often the first trial in any language. It provides a quick lesson in how to publish text to the terminal or other display portal and is familiar to those who have coded before. My goal here was to create an adaptation through a contextual ***'transposition'***  of the original text. Keeping a modicum of the origin wile providing new content or setting. (J. Sanders, 20) That being said, in order to reference the original text, I had to remediate it by taking a photograph. By presenting it in a manner that merely changes the method of the delivery, I am being ***'transparent'***. Had I chosen to declare my photograph the best form of consumption, or somehow having improved the original work, my work would have been considered ***'hypermediacy'***. (A. Hammond, 71)

## Rhetorical Situation
Due to the limited scope of the related discourses, I would not recommend it be used as a means of marketing. Rather a fast and interesting reference into the variations of languages and alphabets. There are however some constraints that must be identified. Both my remediation and adapations above are ***representations*** of originals. The photos of the original text are not actually the text, you cant fold the photo physically as you would with the linen, nor can you use the the photo of the code to program with. You can take the information from either to suit your needs but they are representations of the originals only. The ***connotative*** meaning of a work is the immediate understanding of said work. A person may look at my representation of code and say yes, that is code. ***Denotative*** meaning however represents a deeper context. What is the purpose of the code? What does it do? Is it actually speaking? Etc. Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright, provide these terms as a way to analyze the way we consume and interpret images. 

## Final Thoughts
I found this assignment to be challenging and rewarding. My initial challenge of starting with an old and specialized text and somehow adapting it to modern contexts proved to be quite difficult. While researching this assignment and the Scanner Darkly assignment, I thought it would be fun to come up with a way to utilize the alphabets of old in creating new fonts or typefaces with varying forms of encryption to send coded messages online. It may be shortsighted in that Machine Learning will be able to pick them apart within a few years. Given more time I would have loved to write a program where someone could enter in a text, select a language and have it roughly translated.
